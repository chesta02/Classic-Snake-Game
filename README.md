# üêç Java Classic Snake Game

A simple yet attractive implementation of the classic arcade game **Snake**, built entirely in Java using the **Swing** and **AWT** libraries for a desktop GUI.

This project is great for beginners looking to understand fundamental Java concepts like:
* **GUI Programming** with `JFrame` and `JPanel`.
* **Game Loop** mechanics using `javax.swing.Timer`.
* **Event Handling** for keyboard input (`KeyAdapter`).
* **2D Graphics** rendering with the `Graphics` class.
